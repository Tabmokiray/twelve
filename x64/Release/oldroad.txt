The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine.
At the road's closest approach to the cleft, several
broken pillars jut from the earth where the ravine
widens and opens into something more akin to a
deep, but narrow, canyon. Two of the pillars stand
straight, but most of them lean against the sloped
earth. Others are broken, and several have appar-
ently fallen into the darkness-shrouded depths. A
few similar pillars are visible on the opposite side of
the ravine.
