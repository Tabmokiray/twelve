Long ago there was a citadel, where lived dragons.
The most ancient of them is Ashardalon, red dragon.
Volcanic eruption caused the earth to tremble and crack,
so the citadel fell into the ground and for centuries
no reasonable foot had set foot there.
Are the treasures of the greedy dragons left there?
You travel to the crevasse to find out.
